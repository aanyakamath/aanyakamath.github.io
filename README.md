## Publications

* "A Survey of Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease", July 2023, Accepted for publication in Journal of Student Research High School, [https://aanyakamath.github.io/papers/alz_survey.pdf](https://aanyakamath.github.io/papers/alz_survey.pdf)

This paper surveys surveys the different genetic variants that affect risk for Alzheimer’s Disease, discusses the prevalence of each risk factor, and their effect on Alzheimer’s Disease pathology.

* “Study of Subproteins in Alzheimer’s Disease Pathogenic Variants of PSEN1 and PSEN2”

This research work studies the less-known variants of the PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes that increase risk for Alzheimer’s Disease. This study will identify sub proteins coded in variants of these genes that could increase Alzheimer's risk. I am running similarity comparisons on nucleotide sequence data of variants of the PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes that increase and decrease risk. Regions of similarity in variants that increase risk that are not present in variants that decrease risk, could code for sub proteins that increase risk for Alzheimer’s Disease. I am using python, jupyter and biopython for this work.
