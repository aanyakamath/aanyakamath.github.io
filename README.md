* "A Survey of Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease", November 2023, A Survey of Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease. Journal of Student Research, 12(4)., [https://www.jsr.org/hs/index.php/path/article/view/5246](https://www.jsr.org/hs/index.php/path/article/view/5246)

This paper surveys surveys the different genetic variants that affect risk for Alzheimer’s Disease, discusses the prevalence of each risk factor, and their effect on Alzheimer’s Disease pathology.

* "Potential AD Pathogenic Protein Domains in PSEN1 Isoforms", [https://aanyakamath.github.io/papers/potential_ad_pathogenic_protein.pdf]
* Accepted for Publication in the National High School Journal of Science, Expected Publication: November 2025

This research work identified a potentially pathogenic protein domain encoded in several mRNA transcripts of the PSEN1 gene that could increase risk for Alzheimer’s Disease. I used biopython, STAR, and IGV for this research.

* "PSEN1 and PSEN2 Isoform Protein Structure Database"

This project will create a database of PSEN1 and PSEN2 isoform structures and provide tools to analyze differences in isoform structure.
